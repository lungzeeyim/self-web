## 开始
- Good afternoon, my name is Fred. 
- I’m a Senior Software Developer 
    - with over 4 years of hands-on experience 
    - building scalable, enterprise-grade web applications at HSBC.
- I think I play a role as full stack engineer in my team now.

## 开发
- In my role, I worked extensively with Java SpringBoot and React.js 
    - I contribute and modified codes over more than 10 microservices and frontend components for a private banking platform. 
    - One of my key contributions was the migration of legacy systems from IBM Liberty to SpringBoot, which improved system maintainability and modernize the system.
- I have some experience to optimize complex SQL queries to reduce response time and fix timeout issues, contributing to better system performance
- I've actively participated in regular code reviews, both giving and receiving feedback, which helped improve code quality and maintain consistency across the team. 

## 交流
- I collaborated closely with business teams in Europe and Hong Kong, translating their functional requirements into clean and reliable technical solutions. 
- I’ve worked in cross-functional teams, where clear communication was key to driving project success.
- I enjoy collaborating with others, therefore, I can contribute not just technically, but also as a team player.

## 工作

- I’ve taken on a wide range of responsibilities across both frontend and backend development, from building microservices to optimizing database performance and improving UI components.我在团队中承担了多项核心任务，包括微服务开发、前后端功能实现、数据库优化等。

- I’m used to handling multiple tasks simultaneously, often switching between feature development, bug fixing, and even guding junior developers while ensuring deadlines are met.表达具备多任务处理能力

- I’ve been involved in end-to-end delivery, including requirement analysis, implementation, testing, deployment and final release, which required me to address multiple tasks across different domains.在项目中，我不仅负责编码，还参与需求分析、测试协作、上线部署等多个环节，属于全流程参与者。

Please feel free to ask me any questions about my work experience. Thank you for your time!"

“在我之前的工作中，我们采用两周一个周期的 Agile 模式。每次迭代都有 sprint planning（计划会）、daily stand-up（站会）和 sprint review（评审）。我会和产品团队密切沟通，参与任务优先级的制定，也根据反馈灵活调整开发内容

“In my previous role, we followed Agile using two-week sprints. We had regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. I collaborated closely with product owners and teammates, helping prioritize tasks, give technical input, and adjust plans based on feedback.”
